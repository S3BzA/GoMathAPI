# GoMathAPI

Simple Go API that implements mathematical operations (no frameworks).

## Introduction

Even if the dev life isn't for you, as a cybersecurity enthusiast you should know at least the basics of web development. This project is a simple Go API that implements mathematical operations without using any frameworks. It is intended to help you understand how web servers work and how to create your own APIs.

Why Go? It is simple, fast and the built-in `net/http` package makes it easy to create APIs without worrying about any fancy frameworks.

Why math? Because it is simple and easy to understand. You don't need to know anything about databases or complex business logic to understand how this API works.

A big thank you to [@elliotminns](https://github.com/elliottminns) (Dreams of Code) for his [video](https://youtu.be/H7tbjKFSg58?si=hep2W0kGxAUFcZ--) which inspired me to create this project.

## Bonus Features (WIP or Coming Soon)

### Database Usage

Interaction with a relational Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL).

A simple API is cool and all, but CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) operations are a core part of most web applications. Implementing database interactions will help you understand how to persist data and manage state in your applications.
